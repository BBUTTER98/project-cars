# project-cars
This is is another my application did learning from the course on Udemy, showing practicing on Redux and React-Redux. An App allows you to add a car with a name and
price. Then the care shows bellow on the list and below list you can find a label with total price calculating price from all cars and summing it. You have also search, 
if you search, the list of cars and total price will automaticly update and adjust to the phrase in the search. To use an application you should first clone repositority. Next step is going to project directory and type in console "npm i" to install all dependencies and run two commands "npm run dev" to run an application.
